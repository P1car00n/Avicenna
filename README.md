The app has been designed to streamline the process of appointment booking, management, and communication between doctors and patients. I was responsible for the back-end part written in Djnago, whereas my colleagues took care of the Flutter UI. I'm not proud of how I implemented the REST API, but it was more about learning how to set up several different users and make it all work together. I've learned a lot and might even return to it for improvement.
